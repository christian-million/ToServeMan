# ToSurveyMan

This repository will help me explore how to create classes and methods within R.
Inspired by the [surveydata](https://github.com/andrie/surveydata) package and 
the [stacksurveyr](https://github.com/dgrtwo/stacksurveyr) package, I thought that
 trying to dissect and rebuild the `surveydata` package (with my own spin), could help 
 me understand R Programming a little better.
